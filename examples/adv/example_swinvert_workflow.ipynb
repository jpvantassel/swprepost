    "1. [Defining the inversion target](#Defining-the-Inversion-Target)\n",
    "2. [Selecting the inversion parameterizations](#Selecting-the-Inversion-Parameterizations)\n",

For your convenience, an incomplete `full_path` variable is provided below and commented out. To complete the path you will need to replace `<path_here>` with the actual path. The easiest way to find the full path to your data is by using the Job Status viewer by selecting `Workspace > Tools & Application > Job Status > <Your Job> > More Info > View` which will bring you to your job results. Alternatively, you can move the `3_text` directory form the job archive into the current directory, in which case no changes to `full_path` are necessary.\n",
